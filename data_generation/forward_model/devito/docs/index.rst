Devito - Fast Finite Difference Computation
===========================================

`Devito <http://www.opesci.org/devito-public>`_ is a tool to
perform optimised finite difference (FD) computation from
high-level symbolic problem definitions. Starting from symbolic
equations defined in `SymPy <http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_,
Devito employs automated code generation and just-in-time (JIT)
compilation to execute FD kernels on multiple computer platforms.
Devito is part of the `OPESCI <http://www.opesci.org>`_ seismic imaging
project.
